 # Play Time!
 
 Congratulations! üéâ Now that you know everything about the Tower of Hanoi, it's time to play!
 
 You can use this page to create your own versions of the puzzle with any number of rods and disk stack sizes you want!
 
 - Important:
 The greater the number of disks in a stack, the harder the puzzle gets.
 \
The greater the number of rods, the easier the puzzle gets.
 
 Just remember, if you build the tower with 3 rods, the minimal number of moves required to solve it is given by the equation
 
 * Callout(Equation):
 `Minimal Number of Moves = 2ÀÜ(Number of Disks) - 1`
 
 So... considering that, if you set the number of disks in the stack to 7, you'll be making at least 127 moves...
 
 **Have Fun!** üòÅ
 
 Ahh! And one more thing! If you are wondering what are the moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi, I have compiled some solutions for you in the **Solutions Chapter**. üòâ
