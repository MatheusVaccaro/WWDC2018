Hi! The playground you're about to see is best experienced with the iPad in portrait mode, 
so that the liveView is displayed in landscape mode.

All the sound effects used are royalty free and were provided by Sonnis in their free 
sound packs from the Game Developer Conference 2015, Game Developer Conference 2016 and 
Game Developer Conference 2017.

The background music is "FantasyRPG#2_03.wav" from the royalty free pack "FANTASY RPG Music Pack #2".
